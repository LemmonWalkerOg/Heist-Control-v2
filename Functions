# Cayo Perico (Heist)

Insta-Play (Presets)

This is the function that allows you to quickly play any Cayo Perico heist, without paying for preparations, missions and such things. Some presets already have the values (in %) calculated for each member of your Heist and these values cannot be higher or lower. This can directly affect the payment you will receive in the end.

Approach Vehicles

Here you can choose between just one and all vehicles that will be available to you during the Heist.

Primary Target
All primary targets on the list, plus the exclusive item 'Sapphire Panther' which should probably appear normally for a few times.

Secondary Target
This function has recently been changed as it would affect the way the insta-play presets work and negatively affect the payout calculations for each member.

Change Weapons
You can choose which group of weapons you will use in the heist.

Equipment Location
Do you want all items to spawn near el rubyo's mansion? Yes, that is possible! There are also other locations available to you.

Supply Truck Location
Yes, you can also change where you want the truck to appear during your Heist.

Heist Difficulty
Choose between normal and hard difficulty.

Cayo Perico Awards
You can also unlock all tropheus, achievements and more.
