# Heist Control (v2)

* Heist Control is a LUA-based script. A Script designed to work on menus that support LUA API.

* Its main function is to improve the time we repeat heists, decrease the need to do preparatory missions, help friends who wish to receive the money in an 'honest' way.

* How does Heist Control affect my game?

It only changes some stats, its entire function is based on GTA Online's own stats.

* Can I be banned for changing some stats?

Yes, you can.

* There are no reports of bans during the use or involvement with Heist Control, since the v1 version has proven safe for the time being.

* This project is free. I do not recommend paying for this script if you found it on some random forum on the internet.

* To continue developing, improving and adding more functions to Heist Control, this requires my 2TAKE1 Menu license to be active and this generates costs. 
You can also help me with any kind of donation via paypal.

Attention: The use of this tool is entirely your responsibility, the use can bring risks to your account permanently.

* It was developed especially and exclusively for working with 2TAKE1 Menu. 


# Cayo Perico Heist

* Insta-Play (Presets)

This is the function that allows you to quickly play any Cayo Perico heist, without paying for preparations, missions and such things. Some presets already have the values (in %) calculated for each member of your Heist and these values cannot be higher or lower. This can directly affect the payment you will receive in the end.

* Approach Vehicles

Here you can choose between just one and all vehicles that will be available to you during the Heist.

* Primary Target

All primary targets on the list, plus the exclusive item 'Sapphire Panther' which should probably appear normally for a few times.

* Secondary Target

This function has recently been changed as it would affect the way the insta-play presets work and negatively affect the payout calculations for each member.

* Change Weapons

You can choose which group of weapons you will use in the heist.

* Equipment Location

Do you want all items to spawn near el rubyo's mansion? Yes, that is possible! There are also other locations available to you.

* Supply Truck Location

Yes, you can also change where you want the truck to appear during your Heist.

* Heist Difficulty

hoose between normal and hard difficulty.

* Cayo Perico Awards

You can also unlock all trophies, achievements and more..

## Remove Repeat Cooldown

Unfortunately, after the success of some 'Heist Repeaters' Rockstar has added a server-side feature that are only allowed to pay every 15 minutes in real life.
The Remove Repeat can be useful if you already want to anticipate the progress of the Heist and wait for your 15 minutes to start again

## Set Heist to Default

Useful if you encounter any incompatibility problems or even a strange bug

## Remove all Crew Members (0%)

This removes the payment that is deducted for each crew member at the end of the Heist. This will make sure that you receive the maximum of what you got during the heist.}

The presets that are added:

## Unlock all Doomsday Heist

This function is for those who have never played or hosted this heist before, use it only once to allow you to play without problems

## Set all Preps as Done (Not setups)

This is already self-explanatory, it just prepares all small boring preps in case you want to play only the setups with your friends.

## Set Heist to Default

This will try to restore the heist to default mode, in case you encounter problems in the future

## Doomsday Awards

This will unlock all the achievements that you can get with the Heist.


# High-End Apartment Heists

Unfortunately the functions for this heist are very limited, I am still looking for some other options to try to improve it.

## Set all Setups as Complete

For this to work properly, you must pay to start and then proceed to the missions, then use this function to complete all setups immediately.

## Apartment Heist Awards

This will unlock all the achievements that you can get with the Heist.
