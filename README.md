# Heist-Control-v2

* Heist Control is a LUA-based script. A Script designed to work on menus that support LUA API.

* Its main function is to improve the time we repeat heists, decrease the need to do preparatory missions, help friends who wish to receive the money in an 'honest' way.

* How does Heist Control affect my game?

It only changes some stats, its entire function is based on GTA Online's own stats.

* Can I be banned for changing some stats?

Yes, you can.

* There are no reports of bans during the use or involvement with Heist Control, since the v1 version has proven safe for the time being.

* This project is free. I do not recommend paying for this script if you found it on some random forum on the internet.

* To continue developing, improving and adding more functions to Heist Control, this requires my 2TAKE1 Menu license to be active and this generates costs. 
You can also help me with any kind of donation via paypal.

Attention: The use of this tool is entirely your responsibility, the use can bring risks to your account permanently.

* It was developed especially and exclusively for working with 2TAKE1 Menu. 


# Cayo Perico (Heist)

* Insta-Play (Presets)

This is the function that allows you to quickly play any Cayo Perico heist, without paying for preparations, missions and such things. Some presets already have the values (in %) calculated for each member of your Heist and these values cannot be higher or lower. This can directly affect the payment you will receive in the end.

* Approach Vehicles
*Here you can choose between just one and all vehicles that will be available to you during the Heist.

* Primary Target
All primary targets on the list, plus the exclusive item 'Sapphire Panther' which should probably appear normally for a few times.

* Secondary Target
This function has recently been changed as it would affect the way the insta-play presets work and negatively affect the payout calculations for each member.

* Change Weapons
You can choose which group of weapons you will use in the heist.

* Equipment Location
Do you want all items to spawn near el rubyo's mansion? Yes, that is possible! There are also other locations available to you.

* Supply Truck Location
Yes, you can also change where you want the truck to appear during your Heist.

* Heist Difficulty
Choose between normal and hard difficulty.

* Cayo Perico Awards
You can also unlock all trophies, achievements and more..
