# WARNING:
- Features for high payments has been tested by me since a long time (+1yo) while using CE, stats editor and this script, but now i've implemented such feature to the Heist Control, since none of thoses features are detected atm. May it can change if it became more popular... as always, use at your own risk!

- "Modify Contracts Payout" is pretty new and no idea if it can be bannable, use at your own risk!

Known Issues:
- Loading any other script before Heist Control may triggers weekly event notification (spam), i am current looking into it.
